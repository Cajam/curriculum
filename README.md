# WDI Thoughts and Notes

## Mantras

- Always sort/group the students alphabetically by last name if you want it to look random.
- If it's not on paper, it doesn't exist.
- If it's on paper, it's law.
- Have someone responsible for keeping accountability of everything at all time.

## Relations

Thinking about making an attendance/1on1 tracker.
