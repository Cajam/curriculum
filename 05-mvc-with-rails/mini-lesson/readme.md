# The Art of Pairing

In this mini-lesson, both Matt and Adam will be pairing on building a ruby gem from the ground up.

## The problem

We use several APIs here in DC to manage students, attendance and assignments.

We're currently rewriting a lot of boilerplate code to connect to these APIs to get the information
and parse the JSON.

## The solution

A pairing session where Matt and Adam will build a client Ruby Gem to consume the API and format the data.
