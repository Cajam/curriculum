# GA 101

## Roles

### You do:
On post-its, write down specific action items and measurables that answer the following questions. Then stick the post-its to the board.

- What is the role of the instructor?
- What is the role of the student?
- What is the product that will be delivered by General Assembly to the student?

## Graduation

###What does it mean for a student to graduate?
- They have the highest career-placement priority with Outcomes.
- They are welcome to present at the Meet and Hire.
- They have GA's blessing to inform potential employers (and anyone else) that they are graduates.

### What does it mean for a student to *not* graduate?
- They **are still welcome** to attend class and to attend GA events.
- They **won't be treated any differently** by instructors in the context of the classroom.
- They have low career-placement priority with Outcomes.
- They may not present at the Meet and Hire.
- If someone contacts GA to confirm whether they graduated, GA will have to say "no."

## Hard Requirements

###Everything we say is a suggestion.

The only things you *have* to do to graduate are:

- Be absent no more than 4 days
- Come in tardy no more than 12 days
- Complete 80% of homework
- Earn no more than 2 "does not meet expectations" on Project 1-3, and no more than 1 on Project 4

### To Clarify
- What are "absent" and "tardy"?
  - There is no excused **anything**. This is why we give you 4 days to be absent and 12 days to be tardy.
- What is "complete"?
  - You made a clear effort to solve the homework yourself. If you pulled code from somewhere, you annotated your code saying where you pulled it from. No plagiarism. We can tell.
- What is "does not meet expectations"?
  - Each project will have a rubric

## The WDI Instructors Creed

- What does it mean to be in a "boot camp"?
  - You will be asked to do things you don't necessarily agree with.
    - As in, teaching methods
  - You will be asked to do things that are uncomfortable.
    - This is part of growth.
  - We will not give up on you, even when you have given up on yourself.
  - Ultimately, you have to trust the system.
    - Trust that we have your best interests at heart
    - Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience
  - You can't "win".
    - This is a noncompetitive environment. 
  - You will be re-learning how to learn.
  - You will have to learn to motivate yourself.

Note that none of the above mentions anything about code.

## What do expect?

- For many students, this is the hardest thing they've ever done in their lives.
  - This is the first time they've been bad at something.
  - You can't BS your way through code.
    - The fundamental standard: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
- Memorizing stuff won't really help you.
  - Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence. It's about being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it, and I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."
- Ask for help.
  - This is the thing students find the hardest, and the thing that ultimately determines whether or not they will be successful in this class.
  - Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.

## What is asking for help?

- Asking a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
