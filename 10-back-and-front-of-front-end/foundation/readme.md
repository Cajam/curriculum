## Loaning Objections

## How's this different from Bootstrap?

Wow. We get *way* more changes out-of-the-box.

Plus, we get some extras, like Modernizr, Normalize, Fastclick, and some jQuery plug-ins.

Foundation also gives us some more explicit instructions in their documentation:

- They want us to name our custom stylesheet `app.css`
- They want us to include a `meta viewport` tag
- They want us to include Noramlize

...and who am I to disagree?
