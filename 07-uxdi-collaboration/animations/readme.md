## Intro (10 minutes)

Today we'll be covering 3 major topics, each somewhat related:

* CSS Transforms (2D)
* CSS Transitions
* CSS Animations

**Transforms** are a set of CSS properties that take a an element and transform
it's shape, e.g. rotating it, scaling it, skewing it, etc.

**Transitions** let us tell the browser how to change a property over time. For
example, if the height of an element changes (due to a :hover selector, for
example), we can tell the browser to change the height gradually over 1 second.

**Animations** are similar to transitions, in that they let us have properties
change over time, but they give us more control over how those changes happen.
For example, we have more control over how the animation repeats, change between
multiple values at once, etc.

## Group Breakouts (50 minutes)

Breakout into groups of 4... each group will have 20 minutes to prepare a short
explanation / demo of their assigned topic. Your demos should take **no longer than
5 minutes**.

| Group | Topic                                              |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | CSS Transforms (No animation)                      |
| 2     | CSS Transitions                                    |
| 3     | CSS Animations (basic keyframes and syntax)        |
| 4     | CSS Animations (timing functions)                  |
| 5     | CSS Animations (iterations / repeats / direction ) |
