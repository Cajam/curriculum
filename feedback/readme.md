## Adrian

- Slow my lessons down. Again.
- Lowest individual score was again demonstrating industry knowledge. How can I improve despite not having dev experience outside GA?
- Group: Provide homework feedback more promptly. Although are there ways to change our grading schedule (e.g., grade more assignments) so that students are happier?
- Lowest student rating was by somebody who said my Rails resources lesson "felt scattered" and included a bunch of review, which made me seem unprepared. Need to be more creative with my lesson planning and find fresh ways to re-present material when I have to.

## Andy

- one student mentioned my jokes are on the limit of professionalism, though it is only one, one is enough to cause an issue, so walk a better line keep jokes 100% pc
-  reoccurring themes of liking "i do, you do‚Äù particularly when student gets to watch an instructor do code, and students replicate it in another similar scenario
- students like the long form exercises
- students are liking the notes we make for lesson plans

## Matt

- Improve Hook:  Give overview of what you will learn.  Give them a problem to solve, then help them solve it.
- More Interactive: TO exercises even earlier
- Individual CFU: identify and call on individuals.
- Excitement leads to speed/scattered info: 
   - adding example stories to lesson.  
   - Noticing it and adjusting: multiple times in the last few weeks I have said out loud - "I'm speeding up and getting louder, aren't I?  I love this stuff." And then pause, slow down.  Usually revisit what I just said.
- Timeboxing: My coach diagnosed me with "temporal myopia" (nearsightedness of time).  It's not as much fun as it looks.  Using external timers and the timer script has helped.

## Robin

- I need to keep working on more thorough lesson plans. This will help me slow down.
- I need to make a bigger effort to approach students in-person.
- Figure out the whole "when/how for help" thing
- Differentiation of lessons for students who feel more comfortable with the material, vs those who don't
- Re-frame how valuable students' SOLUTIONS are, not just feedback
- Each morning, have one class do homework review and the other do an exercise or mini-lesson, and students choose their class?
- Late policy. I like having a break at 15 to let late folks come in if we go with the "differentiated morning exercises" idea
- Week-long homework is good
- Outcomes through Github
