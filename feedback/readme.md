# Feedback on Feedback

On Monday, the instructors met to go over your Week 6 feedback and evaluations. These are the notes we wrote down about what we personally and we as a group could do better and think about.

- Delivery
  - Slow down our delivery.
  - We need to continue making our lesson plans very thorough and comprehensive.
    - This may help us to slow down our delivery too.
  - Maintain a respectful and politically-correct atmosphere.
  - Students like "I do, you do" exercises, particularly when student gets to watch an instructor do code, and students replicate it in another similar scenario
  - Students like "long-form" exercises
  - Include more asides: bonus materal, things to Google, etc.
  - Improve hooks: give overviews of what you will learn. Give a problem to solve, then solve it.
  - Checks for understanding: identify and call on individuals
  - Excitement leads to speed/scattered info: 
     - Adding example stories to lesson.  
     - Noticing it and adjusting: "I'm speeding up and getting louder, aren't I?  I love this stuff." And then pause, slow down.  Usually revisit what was just said.
  - Timeboxing: "Temporal myopia" (nearsightedness of time) is not as much fun as it looks. Using external timers and the timer script has helped.
- How can the less-industry-experienced instructors gain relevant experience?
- How to provide feedback more promptly/meaningfully?
  - In the previous WDI, we left comprehensive feedback on *every* homework assignment. It was exhausting for instructors, and the students didn't seem to value it.
  - Can we incorporate students into the grading process?
  - Maybe homework feedback isn't what students are looking for... But additional one-on-one time doesn't seem to be it either?
  - Maybe students just need a clearer picture of how "well" they're doing?
- Be more approachable.
  - Be conscious of when we're being too outgoing, or not outgoing enough
  - Make an effort to not "hide" behind the computer. Challenge ourselves to be social human beings!
  - Make a bigger effort to approach students in-person.
  - More computer-free time with students?
- Prioritize Outcomes over class homework. Students feel there isn't enough time to do both.
  - If Outcomes homework, assign no or very light class homework
  - Ask Outcomes team about having orthogonal lessons/review running concurrently during Outcomes programming for students who don't want Outcomes support?
  - Outcomes submission process
- Fundamentals
  - Communicate the feedback about Fundamentals programming to GA HQ
  - Spend more time on Fundamentals in early weeks of class?
    - Can't rely on students all having gotten same amount from Fundamentals since they will all have completed it differently
- Being available for help
  - Make a calendar of when instructors are avaiable
  - Clarify that questions are *always* welcome; we may just redirect the energy to an online resource
- Differentiation
  - How to frame classes appropriately for students who feel comfortable with material *and* students who feel less comfortable?
  - Each morning, have one class do homework review and the other do an exercise or mini-lesson, and students choose their class?
- Re-frame how valuable students' SOLUTIONS are, not just feedback
- Late policy. Works nicely with "differentiated mornings" idea: if one class is doing homework review, the student can sneak into that class? (Is still marked as tardy)
- Week-long homework is good, as opposed to lots of little homeworks
