# LEARNING OBJECTIVES
- Describe the role Javascript (JS) plays alongside HTML and CSS.
- Describe JS as a programming language.
- Set up and use a REPL to manipulate JS data types.
- List JS data types and how each is used.
- Practice proper JS syntax and semantic variable naming.
- Describe composite data types and use arrays and objects to store data types.
- Explain what a variable is and the role memory allocation plays in storing data types.

// oepning framing/hook? maybe use cookie clicker or some other JS heavy use application
# HTML, CSS and Javascript (20min)
- HTML (content), CSS (style) and Javascript (behavior) as the pillars of web development
- Think-Pair-Share: students identify Javascript features on Facebook homepage
  - 5 minute individual
  - 5 minute pair discussion

// what are the answers to these questions, do you have them in your mind? maybe include them in lesson plan after lessons given.
# JS as a Programming Language (5min)
- What is a programming language?
- What are the particular features of Javascript?
- Question: what tools are part of our JS toolbox?
  - Opportunity for students to list off prework components (e.g., data types, loops, conditionals)

# REPL (5min)
- Introduce concept + set up Node

// i find that if i have examples pre typed up, i'm not as caught up in what the examples are, just focused on delivery of the material
# Primitive Data Types

## Numbers (5min)
- No distinction between integers and floats
```javascript
5
=> 5
```
- Operators + order of operations
- Math object + useful functions
- NaN

## Strings (5min)
- String literals
- Escape sequences
- Concatenation
  - Show which operators you cannot use on strings
- Methods: substring, slice, toUpperCase, etc.

## Booleans (5min)
- True, False
- Comparisons (==, ===, <, >)
  - Briefly mention these are used in conditionals

## Undefined & Null (5min)
- Undefined: automatically applied to a variable with no value
- Null: an explicitly-assigned non-value

# BREAK (10min)

# CODING EXERCISE #1 (15min)
- Temperature conversion

# Composite Data Types

## Arrays (15min)
// include why we use arrays, what advantages does an ordered collection provide
- Ordered collection of data types.
- How to instantiate and access an array.
- Exercise: students identify useful array methods on MDN and familiarize themselves with JS documentation.
  - 5 minute individual research
- Useful methods: push/pop, shift/unshift, etc.

## Objects (5min)
- Unordered, key-value based collections.
- Only a brief mention since they'll be covered on Thursday.

# Variables

## Syntax (5min)
- camelCase
- semicolons
- // Comments

## Semantic Naming (5min)
// use better good/bad variables
- Nope: var num = 5;
- Yup: var myFavoriteNumber = 5;

## Memory Allocation (5min)
// whiteboard var/value chart, i find this to be pretty helpful
- What happens in memory when you create a variable?
- Garbage collection

# BREAK (10min)

# CODING EXERCISE #2 (15min)
- ???
