### Growth Mindset (10 minutes)

[Growth Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_oqghnxBmY_)
- For many students, this is the most mentally challenging thing they've ever done in their lives.
  - This is the first time they've been bad at something.
  - How many people have failed at something? I imagine that everyone has. At some point in this course you will falter. But that's OK! It's how we bounce back, persevere and learn from it that allows our mind to grow.
  - [Emotional Cycle of Change](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/f4/fa/3cf4faeb2078f4f4fbb9265444bde2e0.jpg)
    - uninformed optimism
    - informed pessimism
    - determination/commitment or giving up
    - hopeful realism
    - informed optimism

- Just memorizing stuff won't help you. Learning HOW to code will.
  - You can't BS your way through code.
  - The fundamental standard of programming: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
  - Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."

- So many students throughout my time here say, "I don't know how to do that." or some variation of that. Many of you will say it. Just add "...yet" to it.
- We as instructors anticipate that you will run into hardships. When you do, don't run for the hills! Buckle down and work through the problem. Embrace the fact that the hardship will make you a better coder. Endure the struggle to grow and develop your mind.

### What is an immersive course? (5 minutes)

**Turn & Talk**: What's different about an immersive environment?

- What does it mean to be in a "immersive course"?
  - You will be asked to do things that are uncomfortable.
    - *(Note that when I say "do things", I mean classes and projects, nothing weird.)*
  - You can't "win" -- and can't lose!
    - This is a noncompetitive environment.
  - You will be re-learning how to learn.
    - The last time you spent 9 hours a day learning something new was in high school.
  - Cooperation
    - You'll be eating and living together for the next 12 weeks!
  - Balance
    - Hygeine!
  - We will not give up on you
    - Even when you might have given up on yourself!
    - None of the instructors are here just to collect a paycheck. We're nerds, about web development, education, and you.
  - Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience.
    - In industry
    - At GA
    - We rely on your feedback. At the same time, we ultimately have to trust in our own experience and expertise first.
  - Ultimately, we ask you to **trust us and each other.**
    - Trust that we have each other's best interests at heart.
    - But we expect to have to work to earn that trust.

Note that none of the above mention anything about code.

### What is asking for help? (5 minutes)

- This is the thing students find the hardest, and the thing that ultimately determines whether or not they will be successful in this class.
- Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.

I'm going to ask you to write something on a letter-sized piece of paper. You are allowed no more than 12 words. Please write big enough that someone can read your paper from a few feet away.

When you are done, you will put the paper face-down on your table and leave the room. We'll start again at 11:15.

Now, close your eyes. I want you to write what first comes to mind when I ask you to think of a time you had to ask for help.

*(Collect papers, tape to board for students to review as they re-enter.)*

- We have all asked for help. There's no shame in it. Feeling afraid to ask for help will be the biggest detriment in this class.
- What makes asking for help effective?
  - Asking a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
  - We will turn you away when:
      - The question you're asking isn't constructive
      - It's clear you haven't made an effort to find the answer
          - First, try it yourself
          - Then, Google it
          - Then, ask your neighbor
          - Finally, ask an instructor

### Course content (10 minutes)

#### How the Class is Built

GA has built a baseline curriculum, which includes topics to cover, and a
suggested order. As a local campus, we have built on and modified this
curriculum based on own experiences as instructors, and the unique features
of the DC job market. Each lesson is designed by the instructor that's
delivering it.

We also iterate on this curriculum constantly, so technologies,  concepts, etc,
change with each cohort. Last cohort started with Ruby, but as JS becomes more
and more important, we've started teaching JS first, switching to Ruby, then
back to JS.

#### Course Content

Exercise: Ask students to list technologies / languages that they think are
involved in web development. Examples: HTML, Ruby, Databases, etc.

Map out the technologies and how they relate to each other. Lead a discussion
on which technologies we'll cover, why we chose those, and why we can't cover
everything.

Technologies we cover:

* HTML
* CSS / SASS
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
* MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
* Rails
* Node.js / Express
* Backbone.js / Handlebars Templates

We cover these technologies / topics because they are foundational to web
development, and learning the underlying concepts of how they work prepares you
to learn and work in any web development technologies.

#### Course Sequence

This course has been pretty well-planned for all 12 weeks, but this is subject
to change.

The course is organized by units of roughly 1 week each. Every 3 weeks, we'll
complete a project (~3-5 days each).

Units/Projects:
* Front-end Fundamentals (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Intermediate Front-end (Intermediate JavaScript / jQuery)
* Project 1 - Build an application using HTML / CSS / JS
* Ruby / Data Persistance / Backend Dev w/ Sinatra
* Full-stack MVC w/ Rails
* Project 2 - Build a full-stack, data driven app w/ Rails
* Building APIs with Rails and Express
* Advanced Front-end (using API's on clientside)
* Project 3 - Build a backend API and Front-end that consumes it
* Front-End Frameworks
* Project 4 - Portfolio project

### Course logistics (5 minutes)

#### Weekly schedule

#### Other
- Class staggering
  - Usually, a lesson will be taught twice by the same instructor. So I'll teach HTML this afternoon to one class, and then HTML tomorrow to the other.
  - We'll all have the same lessons and the same homework. Who had what when will just vary by a day or two between the classes.
- One-on-ones
  - Each student will be scheduled one half-hour slot every two weeks during which they will meet with an instructor.
  - Talk about whatever needs to be talked about
  - Should you need additional meetings with instructors, each instructor has open one-on-one time once per week:
    - **Jesse**: Thursday @ 5pm - 5:30pm
- Office Hours
  - Led exclusively by TAs
    - These TAs are outstanding former students from the previous class
  - Usually 4 nights a week, from 5:30 until 7:30
- Instructor Communication
  - Instructors **may not** respond to code questions on Slack nor in-person after 6pm each night, even if we're in the office
  - Should you have a logistical question, you may contact the **Student Communication Manager**
    - This is Robin.
  - All code questions should go to TAs
    - **Question** why would we do this?
    - Answer: Work Life Balance.
  - Student communication manager
    - If you have logistical questions or concerns, contact me (Robin)
- Homework and assessments
  - You'll probably have one homework per lesson, so if you have two lessons in a day, that's two homeworks, graded separately.
  - Homework will be graded only for *completeness*. That is, you actually attempted it yourself and didn't copy code. If you want more feedback, you'll need to ask for it.
  - There will be one homework per week on which your pod leader will leave comments.
  - **Question**: Is it a problem that you'll likely be able to see solutions to homework assignments before you have to do them yourself?
- Absences and Tardies
  - Having more than 4 absences disqualifies you for Outcomes
  - 4 Tardies == 1 Absence
  - Class starts at 9:00am
  - If you arrive after 9:00am, please wait outside the classroom until the next break.
    - You will be marked tardy.
    - We will likely be doing a morning exercise, which you'll be able to find in the class repo.
