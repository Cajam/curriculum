## Intro to WDI (Robin)

## AK: Groth Mindset

- For many students, this is the hardest thing they've ever done in their lives.
  - This is the first time they've been bad at something.
  - You can't BS your way through code.
    - The fundamental standard of programming: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
- Memorizing stuff won't help you.
  - Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence. It's about being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it, and I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."

### Legos

- Inventing Legos is like building a program
  - Have to break it apart
  - How to make a roof out of bricks
  - How to be resourceful
  - Ultimately, you can't be a Lego designer just by looking at people's stuff

## RT: Immersive course

### WE DO

T&T: What's different about an immersive environment?

- What does it mean to be in a "immersive course"?
  - You will be asked to do things that are uncomfortable.
    - *(Note that when I say "do things", I mean classes and projects, nothing weird.)*
  - You can't "win" -- and can't lose!
    - This is a noncompetitive environment. 
  - You will be re-learning how to learn.
    - The last time you spent 9 hours a day learning something new was in high school.
  - Cooperation
    - You'll be eating and living together for the next 12 weeks!
  - Balance
    - Hygeine!
  - We will not give up on you
    - Even when you might have given up on yourself!
    - None of the instructors are here just to collect a paycheck. We're nerds, about web development, education, and you.
  - Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience.
    - In industry
    - At GA
    - We rely on your feedback. At the same time, we ultimately have to trust in our own experience and expertise first.
  - Ultimately, we ask you to **trust us and each other.**
    - Trust that we have each other's best interests at heart.
    - But we expect to have to work to earn that trust.

Note that none of the above mention anything about code.

## AM: What is asking for help?

- Ask for help.
  - This is the thing students find the hardest, and the thing that ultimately determines whether or not they will be successful in this class.
  - Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.

### YOU DO

I'm going to ask you to write something on a letter-sized piece of paper. You are allowed no more than 12 words. Please write big enough that someone can read your paper from a few feet away.

When you are done, you will put the paper face-down on your table and leave the room for a 10-minute break.

Now, close your eyes. I want you to write what first comes to mind when I ask you to think of a time you had to ask for help.

*(Collect papers, tape to board for students to review as they re-enter.)*

# Break!

- We have all asked for help. There's no shame in it. Feeling afraid to ask for help will be the biggest detriment in this class.
- What makes asking for help effective?
  - Asking a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
  - We will turn you away when the question your asking isn't constructive.

## MS: Student Constitution

## We do

T&T: Come up with items for Constitution. Put on board on post-its. Sign. We take picture.

## AB: Class Content

- How the class is created
  - There's a loosely-prescribed curriculum structure; we create all our own lesson plans, incorporating lesson plans we used in the past if possible.
  - Each class is different
    - Factors
      - Personalities
      - Changing technologies
      - Differences between locations
- Deliberate instructor autonomy
  - Much of the course is created on-the-fly to tailor-make the content to the class, since each class is different
  - Lots of flexibility from GA

### WE DO

List out every web technology, acronym, and term we can think of.

- Which of these will we teach?
- Why won't we teach all of them?

## JS: Outcomes

- Who takes this class? Three archetypes
  - Wants to become a developer that we would want to hire. Plans on using Outcomes to pursue job placement.
  - Wants to become a developer that we would want to hire. Plans on pursuing or continuing job placement without Outcomes.
  - Wants to absorb as much knowledge as possible about development.

This class's only requirements are for qualifying for Outcomes. As long as you do not create an environment that precludes others from learning, nothing will preclude you from being able to attend class.

### What does it mean for a student to qualify for Outcomes?
- They have the highest career-placement priority with Outcomes.
- They may present at the Meet and Hire.

### To qualify for Outcomes:

- Have been absent no more than 4 days
- Have been tardy no more than 8 days
- Have completed 80% of homework
- Additionally, earn no more than 1 "does not meet expectations" on Projects 1-3.
- What about Project 4?
  - That's "your project". It marks the transition between us starting to make you a good developer, and you having to take yourself the rest of the way through your career.

- We can't make you do anything. But it would behoove you to participate in outcomes.
  - All three archetypes paid the same amount for this class
  - GA DC has the best Outcomes coordination of any GA campus in the world
  - Unless you have no intention whatsoever of advancing in your professional life, you would benefit greatly from participating in Outcomes programming

### To clarify
- What are "absent" and "tardy"?
  - There is no excused **anything**. This is why we give you 4 days to be absent and 8 days to be tardy.
  - This class is drinking from a firehose. Miss one half a day and you'll spend a lot of time trying to catch up.
  - Please **do not** miss between Thursday of Week 3 and Thursday of Week 4.
- What is "complete"?
  - You made a clear effort to solve the homework yourself. If you pulled code from somewhere, you annotated your code saying where you pulled it from. No plagiarism. We can tell.
- What is "does not meet expectations"?
  - Each project will have a rubric.

## Logistics

- Pods
  - Class is split alphabetically into 6 pods
  - There will be 3 pods per classroom
  - The pods that are together will be rotated after every project so that each pod will have been with each other pod
  - Each pod will have one instructor for the whole class
    - The instructor with whom you'll do one-on-ones
- Class staggering
  - Usually, a lesson will be taught twice by the same instructor. So I'll teach HTML this afternoon to one class, and then HTML tomorrow to the other.
  - We'll all have the same lessons and the same homework. Who was what when will just vary by a day or two between the classes.
- One-on-ones
  - Each student will be scheduled one half-hour slot every two weeks during which they will meet with an instructor.
  - Talk about whatever needs to be talked about
  - Should you need additional meetings with instructors, just ask!
- Office Hours
  - Led exclusively by TAs
  - Usually 4 nights a week, until 7:30
- Instructor Communication
  - Instructors **may not** respond to code questions on Slack nor in-person after 6pm each night, even if we're in the office
  - Should you have a logistical question, you may contact the **Student Communication Instructor**
  - All code questions should go to TAs
  - *Why are we so restrictive about this?*
  - Student communication manager
    - If you have logistical questions or concerns, contact me (Robin)
- Homework and assessments
  - You'll probably have one homework per lesson, so if you have two lessons in a day, that's two homeworks, graded separately.
  - Homework will be graded only for *completeness*. That is, you actually attempted it yourself and didn't copy code. If you want more feedback, you'll need to ask for it.
  - There will be one homework per week on which your pod leader will leave comments whether you like it or not.

### The schedule
- 9-10 Warmup
- 10:12:30 Lesson
- 1:30-4 Lesson
- 4-5 Homework assigned, warm-down
- 5-5:30 One-on-one

- Tuesday
  - Outcomes programming from 3pm onward

- Friday
  - From 9 to 11 will be optional review and an optional mini-lesson
    - If you don't want to come in until 11, then don't. But if you're struggling, the onus is on you to take advantage of the opportunity.
    - Quizzes will be weekly at 11
  - Lab most of day

### Homework app

### WE DO

Turn and talk: What questions and concerns do you have?

Then, I call on the class for questions.

# Break and split into classrooms
